# Prerequisites

## Svelte : [Svelte Docs](https://svelte.dev/).
 

- compiled
Svelte shifts as much work as possible out of the browser and into your build step. No more manual optimisations — just faster, more efficient apps.

- compact
Write breathtakingly concise components using languages you already know — HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Oh, and your application bundles will be tiny as well.

- complete
Built-in scoped styling, state management, motion primitives, form bindings and more — don't waste time trawling npm for the bare essentials. It's all here.


## Firebase : [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs) 

- Firebase, Inc is a set of backend cloud computing services and application development platforms provided by Google. It hosts databases, services, authentication, and integration for a variety of applications, including Android, iOS, JavaScript, Node.js, Java, Unity, PHP, and C++.

- Build
Build powerful apps. Spin up your backend without managing servers. Effortlessly scale to support millions of users with Firebase databases, machine learning infrastructure, hosting and storage solutions, and Cloud Functions.

- Release & Monitor
Improve app quality in less time with less effort. Simplify testing, triaging, and troubleshooting. Carefully roll out features and monitor adoption. Pinpoint, prioritize, and fix stability and performance issues early.

- Engage
Boost user engagement with rich analytics, A/B testing, and messaging campaigns. Understand your users to better support and retain them. Run experiments to test ideas and uncover new insights. Customize your app for different user segments
