# SignedOut

The `SignedOut` component renders content when the current user is `null`. It is a wrapper around the `userStore`. If the user is signed in, the children will not be rendered.

### Slot Props

- `auth` - The current Firebase auth instance

### Example

```svelte
<script>
  import { SignedOut } from "sveltefire";
  import { signInAnonymously } from "firebase/auth";
</script>

<SignedOut>You must be signed in to see this!</SignedOut>

<SignedOut let:auth>
  <button on:click={() => signInAnonymously(auth)}>Sign In</button>
</SignedOut>
```
