# About Creator

Delaney is the creator and mastermind behind Fireship.io, famous for his enigmatic voice, his "100 seconds of Code" series and dry humour.
Jeff Delaney is a Google Developer Expert and the creator of fireship.io. When not writing code, he is out seeking adventure with his wife and 3 boys.


Jeff Delaney (known online as Fireship), is an American variety web development YouTuber who does tutorials on full-stack web development, explanations for various aspects of web technologies, and many original series of tech related videos such as The Code Report, 100 Seconds of Code and Code This, Not That.

Jeff originally started as Angular Firebase, posting tutorials of using Angular, a JavaScript UI framework alongside with Firebase, a service for building databases and back-end infrastructure. By 2018, he published his first popular non-Firebase video about VS Code tips and tricks, up until he finally rebranded as Fireship by 2019.

He currently has three running video series:

- 100 Seconds of X - a short, 100 second video where Jeff provides a very condensed crash course about a particular concept, such as "DNS Explained in 100 Seconds", or a programming language, such as "Python in 100 Seconds". He regularly goes beyond 100 seconds, discussing and explaining further than the regular format, and often invites professional and experienced people to be featured in the video, assisting in the "beyond" section of the video.

- Code This Not That - a varied video format where Jeff showcases common mistakes or non productive habits commonly seen in development environments, one of these is "10 CSS Pro Tips - Code this, NOT that!", where he showcases 10 tips and tricks about CSS.

- The Code Report - A series of news-like of major events in the tech industry, the first episode: "How a CS student tracks Elonâ€™s Private Jet with Python // The Code Report", where Jeff reports the story of Jack Sweeney, a then 19-year-old Python developer, created a bot that tracked and disseminated information about Elon Musk's one and only private jet. He also covers JavaScript frameworks and AI-related news as well.
